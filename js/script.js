      <span class="fw-medium">Entering into a legally binding contract</span>
      <ul class="list-alpha">
        <li>A contract between you and us will come into being in one of two ways: <ul class="list-roman">
            <li>When you sign the quotation we and you will enter into a legally binding contract on the date you sign.</li>
            <li>Where you and we agree orally that we should provide the Services then there will be a legally binding contract on the date of our oral agreement.</li>
          </ul>

        <li>Before you sign the quotation or orally agree to us providing Services, we suggest you read through these terms and conditions. If you have any questions concerning them please ask us.</li>

      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="fw-medium">Providing the Services</span>
      <ul class="list-alpha">
        <li>Once we and you have entered into a legally binding contract we will normally start providing the Services to you straight away or on a date agreed between us without further discussion with you. Occasionally the Services will be provided at some other date or time or be dependent on a number of factors.</li>
        <li> We aim to always provide you with the Services: <ul class="list-roman">
            <li>using reasonable care and skill;</li>
            <li>in compliance with commonly accepted practices and standards in the production industry; and</li>
            <li>in compliance with New South Wales laws and regulations in force at the time we are carrying out the Services.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="fw-medium">Days and times when we normally provide the Services and performance of Services away from the Premises</span>
      <ul class="list-alpha">
        <li> Unless you and we agree otherwise, we will provide the Services on normal working days and start work no earlier than 9 am and finish work no later than 5 pm. A normal working day for us means Mondays to Fridays, excluding any bank or other national holidays. </li>
        <li> The performance of some of the Services may take place away from the Premises. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="fw-medium">Materials</span>
      <br /> At the time we perform the Services, we may not have all the materials we need to perform the Services. This may be for a number of reasons such as: <ul class="list-alpha mb-2">
        <li> we have not provided an estimate and cannot reasonably establish what Materials are necessary until we start performing the Services; or </li>
        <li> where we have provided an estimate, it may not have been reasonably possible to establish the need for particular Materials at the time we provided the estimate. The need for the particular Materials may only be revealed when we start performing the Services; or </li>
        <li> whether or not we have provided an estimate, the condition of an item or the area which is the subject of the Services may only become apparent when we start performing the Services and it was not reasonably possible to establish it until that point. </li>
      </ul> In such cases, we may need to purchase Materials. If the Materials are available from a local supplier then we normally wish to travel to the supplier purchase the Materials and return to continue performing the Services. We normally charge for the travel time at our normal charging rate. If the Materials are not available from a local supplier we normally order the Materials and return on another occasion to continue to perform the Services. We will not charge you for any time spent in obtaining Materials if we have brought or ordered the wrong Materials. In such circumstances, we will normally charge for the time spent in making telephone calls to suppliers or our office to locate the required Materials.

          <span class="list-counter">6.1.</span>
          <p class="fw-medium"> Our responsibility to perform the Services by particular dates </p> We aim to carry out the Services by the dates and times we either agree with you or notify to you. But we cannot guarantee or provide a firm commitment that: <ul class="list-alpha">
            <li>we will start performing the Services by a specified date or time; or</li>
            <li>we will complete the performance of all the Services by any specified date or time; or</li>
            <li>the performance of any individual part of the Services will be completed by a specified date or time.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-counter">6.2.</span>
          <p class="fw-medium"> What can happen if we cannot start performing the Services or complete performing the Services </p>
          <ul class="list-alpha">
            <li> Subject to clause 6.3, if we do not start or complete performing the Services within a reasonable period from the date(s) we have agreed or notified then you may either: <ul class="list-roman">
                <li>choose to continue to wait until we can start performing the Services or complete performing them; or</li>
                <li>terminate the contract.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Where we have started performing the Services and you decide you wish to terminate the contract you will only have to pay for any Services we have performed up to the date of termination and for any Materials which we have a legal obligation to pay for. If you have made payment(s) to us in excess of the amount of Services we have performed or Materials we have purchased, we will return the difference to you within 14 days of the termination. </li>
            <li> What is a reasonable period of time depends on the type of Services we will be performing and the length of time they will take to perform. For example, if you and we believe that the Services will take only a few hours to perform, then if we fail to start performing the Services within eg half a day then you may have the right to terminate the contract. But if the Services are due to take several weeks to perform, then if we fail to start to perform the Services after a couple of weeks when we are due to or we do not perform the Services during a couple of weeks when we were due to, then in such circumstances, you may be entitled to terminate the contract. </li>

          <span class="list-counter">6.3.</span>
          <p class="fw-medium"> Situations or events outside our reasonable control </p>
          <ul class="list-alpha">
            <li> In addition, there are certain situations or events which occur which are not within our reasonable control, including: <ul class="list-roman">
                <li> if the Materials are not delivered on the date or at the time agreed with the supplier of the Materials (and it is not possible to obtain a replacement from an alternative supplier at all or within a reasonable amount of time, or the price charged by the alternative supplier is excessively higher than by the original supplier if ordered at short notice); </li>
                <li> where you make a change in the Services you wish us to perform (and this results in, for example, us having to do further work or wait for new or different Materials); </li>
                <li> where we have to wait for other providers of services (who have been engaged by you) to complete their work before we are able to perform the Services (or the relevant part of the Services dependent on the other provider if ordered at short notice); </li>
                <li> where we are unable to gain access to the Premises to carry out the Services at the times and dates we have agreed with you;</li>
                <li> where the areas in the Premises have not been readied by you as we and you have agreed in order for us to perform the Services;</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> A <span class="fw-medium">Force Majeure Event</span> may also occur. A Force Majeure Event means an event adversely impacting our ability to provide Services that is beyond our reasonable control, such as fire, flood, natural or man-made disasters, civil commotion, industrial action, war (declared or undeclared), pandemic, and restrictions and prohibitions or any other actions by any government or quasi-government authorities. If we are unable to provide the Services because of a Force Majeure Event, then we: <ul class="list-roman">
                <li>will notify you of this fact and to what extent our ability to perform our obligations under this Agreement is affected;</li>
                <li>if we have issued a notice pursuant to subclause (a) above, we are temporarily relieved from performing the obligations specified in the notice for the duration of the delay arising directly out of the Force Majeure Event; and</li>
                <li>will use our best endeavors to minimize the impact of any Force Majeure Event.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> If a delay arising directly out of a Force Majeure Event or an event specified in 6.3(a) continues for more than 3 months, you may: <ul class="list-roman">
                <li>continue to wait until we are able to recommence performing the Services. If you are required to make any payments during this period (for example if we and you have agreed that you will pay us in staged amounts) then we will not require you to make any of the payments required until we are able to recommence performing the Services; or</li>
                <li>terminate the contract. If you choose this option then you will only have to pay for any Services we have performed up to the date of termination and for any Materials for which we have a legal obligation to pay. If you have made payment(s) to us in excess of the amount of Services we have performed or Materials we have purchased, we will return the difference to you within 14 days of cancellation.</li>

          <span class="list-counter">7.1</span>
          <p class="mb-20 fw-medium">Our charges are based on time spent</p>
          <p class="mb-20"> We normally charge for our services on a time basis. We spend in providing our Services. Our rates, excluding GST, for performing the Services are set out on the quotation we provide for the particular project. </p>
          <p> The following is an example of how our charging structure works: If we complete performing the Services within 50 minutes where the charging period is 30 minutes we will charge for 2 x 30-minute periods. If we go over into another 30-minute period by a few minutes, at our discretion, we may charge up to the last period completed. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="list-counter">7.2</span>
          <p class="mb-20 fw-medium">Our charges are based on estimate</p>
          <ul class="list-alpha">
            <li> If we provide an estimate then we will charge you the amount stated in the estimate rather than a charge based on the time taken to perform the Services. Note: we only provide estimates and not quotations or binding indications of how much we will charge. Estimates are normally valid for a period of 14 days from the date they are given. </li>
            <li> As we provide an estimate we may need to charge you a higher amount than stated in the estimate. This can occur for a number of reasons, in particular where: <ul class="list-roman">
                <li> what you require us to do changes, or the amount of work or Services you require us to provide increases or is different to what we and you agreed before we started performing the Services; or </li>
                <li> when we start performing the Services it becomes apparent that the amount of Services we will need to perform or the type of work that is involved is different to what we agreed before we started performing the Services and we could not reasonably foresee this before we started performing the Services. </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li> Where the amount of work involved is greater than that stated in an estimate (as set out in paragraph (b)) then the following will happen: <ul class="list-roman">
                <li> if the amount of extra time we need to spend to finish performing the Services will mean that the extra amount payable by you will not exceed 10% of the amount stated in the estimate, then we will carry on providing and completing the Services without contacting you and obtaining your agreement; </li>
                <li> otherwise, we will not continue performing the Services and we will seek your approval to the extra amount that you will need to pay, unless: <ul class="list-upper-alpha">
                    <li> it is not possible to contact you within a reasonable time; or </li>
                    <li> it is not safe not to carry out and finish performing the Services (for example, your goods or premises may be left in a dangerous condition or unprotected from theft if the Services are not completed). </li>

            <li> in a number of staged payments, often involving: <ul class="list-roman">
                <li> the payment of a deposit of 50% before we commence performing the Services; and </li>
                <li> the payment of the remaining amount we will be charging you either on completion of the Services or in a number of fixed payments paid at regular periods. </li>
              </ul>

            <li> if the amounts not paid represent more than 50% of the total value of the Services we are to perform for you, and there remain some Services that we have not yet performed, then we may suspend performing the remaining Services until you make payment. </li>

        <li> If we agree to terminate the contract then you will be responsible for the cost of: <ul class="list-roman">
            <li> any of our time in performing the Services up to the date we stop providing the Services; and </li>
            <li> any Materials we are contractually committed to buying up to the date of termination (whether or not we need to pay for them before or after the date the contract between us and you is terminated).

        <li> In the circumstances stated in paragraph (b) we will first deduct the amounts for which you are responsible from any deposit you have paid. Any remaining deposit will be returned to you.

          </ul>
        </li> we do not have to accept your termination of the contract except as provided in paragraph (b) or as otherwise provided for in this contract. However, we may choose to accept termination of the contract, and if we choose to do so you will be required to pay us a reasonable amount for the losses and costs (including loss of profit) we have suffered. If you have paid a deposit, this will be retained and if our reasonable losses and costs (including loss of profit) are greater than the deposit we have retained we will require you to pay for our losses and costs in excess of the deposit retained.

        <li>we are changing the rates we charge for the provision of Services as provided in clause 7; or</li>
        <li>we need to correct any errors or omissions (and this right includes the right to change any of the documentation that forms part of the contract), as long as such correction is minor and does not materially affect the contract.</li>
